    "## Integrator Anit-windup\n",
    "One potential problem, that can cause big issues in practice, is the concept of integrator windup.  When the error is large and it persists for a long time, the $u_I$ term can become very large, i.e. \"wind up\".  This can then case large control efforts in the direction to correct the error, which will often dramatically overshoot and destabalize the system.\n",
    "The key in implementation is to add a scheme to guard against wind-up. We summarize two schemes here: \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sum Steady-state Only\n",
    "In this scheme, the idea is to only allow the integrator to sum when the derivative term is low, under some threshold $\\bar{v}$; meaning the system is likely in steady state and not in the transient porition of it's response. It would look something like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "`if np.abs(differentiator) < vbar\n",
    "    integrator = integrator + (Ts/2.)*(error + error_old)\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saturation Bound Output\n",
    "This scheme seeks to subtract from the integrator term the exact amount needed to keep the output $u$ from saturating.  The implementation would look something like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "Compute the unsaturated outputs\n",
    "$$ u_{\\text{unsat}} = k_P e[n] + k_D u_D[n] + k_I u_I[n].$$\n",
    "Then saturate the output\n",
    "$$ u[n] = \\text{sat}(u_{\\text{unsat}}), $$\n",
    "but before the function completes and the saturated control signal is sent to the actuators, we rewrite $u_I[n]$ as\n",
    "$$ u_I[n] = u_I[n-1] + \\frac{1}{k_I}(u - u_{\\text{unsat}}), $$\n",
    "which is the updated value of the integrator that ensures that the control signal remains just out of saturation.  Note that if the control value is not in saturation then $u=u_{\\text{unsat}}$ and the integrator value remains unchanged.  This scheme is demonstarted in the sample PID control code above. \n"

    "## Gain Selection for PID\n",
    "Gain selection for PID control usually proceeds in the following manner.  \n",
    " * The proportional and derivative gains $k_P$ and $k_D$ are first selected according to the methods discussed in Chapter 8.  \n",
    " * The integral gain $k_I$ is then tuned by starting with zero and then slowly increasing the gain until the steady state error is removed.  The parameters associated with the anti-windup scheme, especially $\\bar{v}$, are also adjusted during this phase.  \n",
    " * The proportional and derivative gains can then be adjusted if necessary by re-tuning $\\omega_n$ and $\\zeta$.  \n",
    " * In the case of successive loop closure, integrators are only added on the outer loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The addition of an integrator has a destabilizing effect on the feedback system.  This effect is most easily understood by using the root locus method described in Appendix E, where it can be seen that for second order systems, a large $k_I$ will always result in closed loop poles in the right half plane.  The root locus can also be used to aid in the selection of the integral gain $k_I$, where the value of $k_I$ is selected so that integrator has minimal impact on the closed loop poles designed using PD control.  A more effective method for selecting integral gains will be discussed in Chapter 12."
